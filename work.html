<h1>Experience</h1>

<p>Technical Lead at <a href="https://lab9.co">Lab9</a>, remote</p>
<p>2021 - present</p>

<p>I joined Lab9 in 2021, where I helped the company grow from zero to deploying more than 30 software projects to production, ranging from static sites to complex systems handling hundreds of thousands of requests every day and more than 5000 business operations per day.</p>

<p>I've led and supervised projects using Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, working with technologies like React, Node.js, Express, FastAPI and Django, as well as various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis) and message queues (RabbitMQ, BullMQ). Additionally, I have assisted in debugging projects in .NET, PHP, Ruby, WordPress and many other languages and frameworks as needed.</p>

<p>I've also managed around 20 Linux virtual private servers and worked across cloud environments such as AWS, Heroku and Google Cloud.</p>

<p>My main focus at Lab9 is to lead a team of more than 15 developers across various software projects while establishing a development culture within the organization and researching which technologies the company should explore for future projects.</p>
