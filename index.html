<h4>Game dev:</h4>

See <a href="games.html">Games<a>

<h4>Main Languages:</h4>
<h2>C++</h2>  
<p>
	I have been working with C++ for around two years, I try to make my projects around C++11 features but sometimes I add some C++14, 17 and even 20 features. 
	You can check some projects that I made with SDL2 in my Github account, including some games and a simple game engine. I can easily pick up new libraries and work with them.

<h3>Python</h3>  
<p>I made some APIs with Flask and with FastAPI, I also know how to write webapps with Flask and Django, using SQLite or PostgreSQL for database, SQLAlchemy for ORM and libraries like Flask-JWT and some others. I worked a lot with requests and BS4 in order to scrape data from websites. I use Python almost daily to solve day-to-day problems, I can easily pick new libraries if needed. You can check my github account to see some projects that I made.</p>

<h3>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h3> 
<p>I made this website without any templates. I have a very good understanding of modern Javascript (ES 6/7), I made some projects in React and Vue. In addition you can look the Flask and Django projects that are in my Github where I use Vanilla JS, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, etc</p>
