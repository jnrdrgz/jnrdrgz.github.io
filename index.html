	<h1>About me</h1>
	<div id="maintext">
	<p>I'm a self-taught 21 years old programmer currently living in San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina. I have <a href="#mainlang">some experience</a> programming in C++ and Python (but if you want to hire me to learn something else I don't have any problem with that, I do it very quickly and I can do it on my own). My two passions in this field are game development and cybersecurity. If you want to see some things that I programmed check my <a href="https://github.com/jnrdrgz">Github account</a>, if you want to hire me <a href="#contact">contact me</a> or check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-ignacio-rodriguez-707644178/"> LinkedIn</a>, you can also check my <a href="#cv">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p>
